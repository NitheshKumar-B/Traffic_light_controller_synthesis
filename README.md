# Traffic_light_controller_Synthesis

## Aim:

Synthesize Traffic Light Controller design using Constraints and analyse area and Power reports.

## Tool Required:

Functional Simulation: Incisive Simulator (ncvlog, ncelab, ncsim)

Synthesis: Genus

### Step 1: Getting Started

Synthesis requires three files as follows,

◦ Liberty Files (.lib)

◦ Verilog/VHDL Files (.v or .vhdl or .vhd)

### PROGRAM:
traffic_light.v:

```
`timescale 1 ns / 1 ps
module TrafficLight(input clk, //LED_NS represent the North-South LEDs
		    input rst, //LED_WE represent the West-East LEDs
		    output reg [2:0] LED_NS, LED_WE);
/*Let 100 = Red
      010 = Yellow
      001 = Green 
We have 6 different states, defining them below */

parameter S0 = 6'b000001,   //When NS is green and EW is red
	  S1 = 6'b000010,   //When NS is yellow and EW is red
	  S2 = 6'b000100,   //When NS is red and EW is red
	  S3 = 6'b001000,   //When NS is red and EW is green
	  S4 = 6'b010000,   //When NS is red and EW is yellow
	  S5 = 6'b100000;   //When NS is red and EW is red
//Then the cycle repeats

reg [5:0] state;
reg [3:0] count;

//Defining transition of states
always@(posedge clk or posedge rst)
begin
if(rst) begin    //Active HIGH reset
state <= S0;
count <= 0; end
else 
begin
case(state)
S0: begin 
	if(count == 4'd14)
	begin count <= 0;
	state <= S1; end
	else begin 
	count <= count + 1; state <= S0; end end
S1: begin 
	if(count == 4'd2)
	begin count <= 0;
	state <= S2; end
	else begin 
	count <= count + 1; state <= S1; end end
S2: begin 
	if(count == 4'd2)
	begin count <= 0;
	state <= S3; end
	else begin 
	count <= count + 1; state <= S2; end end
S3: begin 
	if(count == 4'd14)
	begin count <= 0;
	state <= S4; end
	else begin 
	count <= count + 1; state <= S3; end end
S4: begin 
	if(count == 4'd2)
	begin count <= 0;
	state <= S5; end
	else begin 
	count <= count + 1; state <= S4; end end
S5: begin 
	if(count == 4'd2)
	begin count <= 0;
	state <= S0; end
	else begin 
	count <= count + 1; state <= S5; end end
endcase
end
end
/*    100 = Red
      010 = Yellow
      001 = Green     */

//Output of LEDs//

always@(*)
begin
case(state) 
S0: begin LED_NS = 3'b001;  LED_WE = 3'b100; end
S1: begin LED_NS = 3'b010;  LED_WE = 3'b100; end
S2: begin LED_NS = 3'b100;  LED_WE = 3'b100; end
S3: begin LED_NS = 3'b100;  LED_WE = 3'b001; end
S4: begin LED_NS = 3'b100;  LED_WE = 3'b010; end
S5: begin LED_NS = 3'b100;  LED_WE = 3'b100; end
endcase
end

endmodule
```
traffic_light_tb.v:

```
`timescale 1 ns / 1 ps

module TrafficLight_tb();

reg rst, clk;
wire [2:0] LED_NS, LED_WE;

TrafficLight L(clk, rst, LED_NS, LED_WE);

initial begin 
clk = 1;
forever #1 clk = ~clk;
end

initial begin
   rst = 1;

#10 rst = 0;

#4000 $finish;
end

endmodule
```
run.tcl:
```
read_libs /cadence/install/FOUNDRY-01/digital/90nm/dig/lib/slow.lib
read_hdl traffilight.v
elaborate
read_sdc input_constraints.sdc

syn_generic
syn_map

write_hdl > traffic_netlist_without.v
write_sdc  > output_constraints.sdc

gui_show

report area > traffic_area.rpt
report gates > traffic_gates.rpt
```   


### Step 2 : Creating an SDC File

•	In your terminal type “gedit input_constraints.sdc” to create an SDC File if you do not have one.

### Step 3 : Performing Synthesis

The Liberty files are present in the library path,

• The Available technology nodes are 180nm ,90nm and 45nm.

• In the terminal, initialise the tools with the following commands if a new terminal is being used.

◦ csh

◦ source /cadence/install/cshrc

• The tool used for Synthesis is “Genus”. Hence, type “genus -gui” to open the tool.

• Genus Script file with .tcl file Extension commands are executed one by one to synthesize the netlist.

Result:

The generic netlist of Traffic Light Controller has been created, and area, power reports have been tabulated and generated using Genus.
